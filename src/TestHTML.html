    <h1>This is the Body of the Page</h1>
    <p>Anything within the body of a web page is 
       displayed in the main browser window.</p>
    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of 
       the page. And if the page is a long one it might 
       be split up into several sub-headings.</p>
    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Many long articles have sub-headings to help you 
       follow the structure of what is being written. 
       There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
       headings).</p>
    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading</p>
    <p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>
    <p lang="fr">Paragraphe en Francais</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
      Winnie-the-Pooh">
      <p>Did you ever stop to think, and forget to start 
         again?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As A.A. Milne said, <q>Some people talk to 
       animals. Not many listen though. That's the
       problem.</q></p>
